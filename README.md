# Karaoke Night - Full-Stack Web Application

This is a full-stack web application where users are able to enter their email, name, and their song request to be put on the karaoke queue. Based on the song request they choose, the user can also get a list of songs similar to their request.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned 

I didn't realize the API I was using was broken until I spent hours trying to debug my code to figure out why my simple fetch wasn't working. Overall, I had a lot of fun building this full-stack web application because I love karaoke and I love getting similar song recommendations whenever I am actually karaoking.
